# Getting Started with Create React App

This is a short tutorial created for people trying to learn popular React hooks and a few very useful Custom hooks

## All React Hooks used
* useState
* * Allows you to track and manage State in a functional component
* useEffect
* * Perform side effects in functional components. Fires on all renders by default, on first render when empty dependncy array, or any time a dependency changes if it is passed to the array.
* useRef
* * Maintains a value between renders
* useReducer
* * Same as useState but allows custom state logic

## All Custom Hooks
* useToggle
* useDebounce
